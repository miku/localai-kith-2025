## A simple agentic loop

Take a PDF, chop of individual pages; summarize each page; find additional
information; relate the page to other pages in the document or a set of
documents. Try to find contrarian views. Try to find supporting views.

## support email preparation

Docs, scrape, database, facts and context engineering.

## city.grep

images to text; search a city for services; etc.

## a data conversion loop

you have data in format A (and examples) and you want format B (and you can provide a few examples)

loop writes a small python file, runs in a container with random subset of
input, compares the output, feeds error back to llm, continue until tests pass
