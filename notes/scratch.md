## Economic impact

> AI will drive this growth in three important ways. First, it will
lead to a strong increase in labour productivity (by up to 40 %) due to
innovative technologies enabling more efficient workforce-related time
management. Secondly, AI will create a new virtual workforce – described as
'intelligent automation' in the report – capable of solving problems and
self-learning. Third, the economy will also benefit from the diffusion of
innovation, which will affect different sectors and create new revenue streams. -- [EPRS | European Parliamentary Research Service, July 2019](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2019/637967/EPRS_BRI(2019)637967_EN.pdf)

Automation potential in many areas; not realized; AI not needed, but data
available for AI may lead to more pressure to rethink current practices.

### Some questions

* Can you access and work with all data that is relevant to your domain in an
  easy way?
* Ratio: unique, specific tasks, chore tasks?

## Outlook

* who does not love a reliable assistant for everyday tasks!
* offline use cases are better to start with (cheaper, easier to experiment with, ...)
* stay in control of your prompt and data and document your process; in the best case, own all of the stack
* just wait a few more years until the dust settles; do a small project now, then wait and observe
